In the event that Intex is missing deal or data information in the template, the Investor Report or Prospectus should be reviewed to obtain the necessary details. For new issuances where Intex lacks any information on the deal, it is essential to contact the Investment Portfolio Team to gather all the required information for the specific deal. Any information provided by the Investment Portfolio Team should be properly documented and backed up.
