### **Top 5 Observations on State Street's Correlation with Peers and KRE**

1. **High Correlation with Custodian Banking Peers**  
   State Street demonstrates a consistently high correlation with other leading custodian banks, such as BNY Mellon (BK) and Northern Trust (NTRS), driven by similar business models focused on asset servicing, custody, and fee-based income streams.

2. **Shared Sensitivity to Interest Rate Movements**  
   The earnings profiles of State Street and its peers are significantly influenced by changes in interest rates, as both derive substantial revenue from net interest income on client deposits. Rising rates generally support higher earnings, resulting in synchronized stock price movements.

3. **Influence of Market-Linked Assets Under Custody (AUC/A)**  
   Both State Street and its competitors exhibit correlation due to their reliance on assets under custody and administration (AUC/A). Fluctuations in global equity and fixed income markets directly impact their fee revenues, aligning performance trends across the group.

4. **Correlation with KRE Reflects Broader Sector Dynamics**  
   While State Street is not a traditional regional bank, its stock price exhibits periodic correlation with the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE), largely due to broader investor sentiment towards the financial sector, particularly in periods of heightened market volatility or regulatory focus on banks.

5. **Differentiation Through Business Diversification and Scale**  
   Despite correlations, State Street’s global scale, leadership in ETF management through State Street Global Advisors (SSGA), and diversified client base contribute to differences in risk exposure and valuation drivers compared to both its custody banking peers and regional banks represented in KRE.
