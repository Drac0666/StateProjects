The application should be enhanced with a Task Scheduler to enable certain codes to run automatically on a daily or specific schedule. Additionally, a bookmarking feature should be implemented, allowing for 5-10 bookmarks. Currently, we have a history feature, but it does not provide the same functionality. For instance, if I run a particular code 10 times, the history loses track of codes I execute on a monthly basis.
