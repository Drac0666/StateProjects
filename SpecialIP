📌 Key Takeaways: CMIS Nederland, RMBS Risk & NatWest Lawsuit
🏛️ 1. CMIS Nederland’s Legal Liability

    CMIS was found liable by the UK High Court to pay €155 million to NatWest.

    The dispute concerned 7 Deeds of Indemnity linked to RMBS swap transactions (2006–2008).

    The court ruled these were indemnities, not guarantees — meaning CMIS had a primary payment obligation.

📜 2. Purpose of the Deeds of Indemnity

    Used in RMBS structures to secure swap obligations owed by SPVs to NatWest.

    Ensured NatWest would be paid even if the SPV failed to meet its obligations.

    CMIS signed them to support transactions known as EMAC deals.

🧱 3. RMBS Structures Are Legally Isolated

    Mortgage loans were sold to SPVs via true sale.

    CMIS's own financial problems do not allow creditors to access SPV assets.

    RMBS principal and interest payments are protected by legal structure.

💸 4. Can RMBS Payments Be Taken to Repay NatWest?

    ❌ No — CMIS cannot use RMBS principal payments to cover its debt to NatWest.

    The €155M obligation is enforceable only against CMIS, not the RMBS trust or SPVs.

⚠️ 5. Risks to Investors in CMIS-Serviced RMBS

    Operational risk if CMIS fails (delays, reporting issues, transition to backup servicer).

    No direct financial loss from CMIS legal case unless servicing collapses without replacement.

    Important to verify trustee protections, backup servicer, and waterfall mechanics.

🔗 6. ABN AMRO Connection to NatWest

    Some 2007 RMBS deals list ABN AMRO as swap counterparty.

    After 2007, RBS (now NatWest) acquired ABN AMRO’s investment banking division.

    Many swap obligations were transferred to NatWest, explaining current involvement.
