Populate the REF RESILOAN file with all U.S. RMBS securities and the required information necessary to calculate the W parameter. This process is supported by the 'USRMBS_DQ_Resiloan' sheet in the SSFA file. Populate the CUSIP in Column A, 90+ Delinquency in Column E, Foreclosure in Column F, REO in Column G, and Bankruptcy in Column H. The sum of all these values, represented in Column I, should be copied into the REF RESILOAN file along with the corresponding CUSIPs.
