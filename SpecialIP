While State Street is not classified as a regional bank, its stock price exhibits periodic correlation with the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE), reflecting broader investor sentiment toward the financial sector. Additionally, this relationship may be influenced by the fact that State Street Global Advisors (SSGA), a subsidiary of State Street, manages the KRE ETF, creating a potential operational linkage. Notably, during the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapse in March 2023, the correlation between State Street and KRE decreased compared to historical norms. This divergence may reflect increased investor awareness of the distinct risk profiles between large global custodian banks and the regional banking segment represented by KRE.
