Hi John,

Regarding our stock performance analysis and its correlation/trends with regions, I will conduct the necessary analysis and get back to you with the results.

As for your second question, we have reworked this process to run without Bloomberg, utilizing a combination of Bloomberg Back Office and the PSDL solution. I will need to obtain some identifiers to check their availability. However, expanding this report to cover additional movements may incur some extra costs.

Additionally, please note that data for Pacific Western Bank is no longer available as it was acquired by Bank of California. Is there anything specific you would like to see as a replacement for Pacific?

Let me know your thoughts.
