During one of our recent monthly processes, I identified a discrepancy in an Italian RMBS bond. It appears that the "PAR" column may represent the USD equivalent, while all these Italian bonds are denominated in euros. I recalculated the INTR - Par/Curr Face values by applying the FX rate provided in the file. In doing so, I discovered a difference of 100 between the "PAR" and "INTR" values for one of the bonds.

Additionally, I noticed that the GAAP BV INTR Variance column reflects the same variance for this particular bond.

Could you please clarify the cause of this discrepancy? Any additional context or insights would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your assistance.
