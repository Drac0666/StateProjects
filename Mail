Dear [Executive Board Member's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to bring to your attention an important matter regarding our internal processes and thresholds that has recently come to light.

We have identified an issue within our internal processes, specifically related to our thresholds. It appears that some of these thresholds were not updated to reflect the values approved by the committee in March 2022. Regrettably, this oversight has meant that we have been operating with outdated thresholds for a significant period.

Upon discovering this issue, we took immediate action to rectify the situation. We have diligently reviewed and updated all relevant documents to align them with the approved thresholds. As a result of these updates, certain securities are now outside of the approved thresholds, and we believe it is crucial to bring this to your attention.

For a comprehensive understanding of the changes made and the securities that require acknowledgment, we have prepared a detailed report, which can be found in the attached file.

We understand the importance of maintaining compliance and transparency in our operations, and we are committed to ensuring that such oversights do not recur. We appreciate your attention to this matter and kindly request that you review the attached document at your earliest convenience.

If you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly. Your feedback and guidance are highly valued.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
